//! `anneal-exec` — the execution kernel (§7).
//!
//! A deep module. Its public surface is essentially one method —
//! [`Executor::execute`] — which turns an [`Action`] into an [`ActionResult`].
//! Everything about *how* an action runs is hidden behind that interface, split
//! into four private concerns (the layering from the design doc):
//!
//! | module        | concern                | answers                         |
//! |---------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|
//! | [`action`]    | the action spec (§19.1) + cache-key | *what* is being run         |
//! | [`cache`]     | action cache (§8.1)    | *have we already run this?*     |
//! | [`materializer`] | CAS ↔ filesystem (§3.4) | *where do the bytes go?*     |
//! | [`sandbox`]   | OS isolation (§7.3)    | *what is the action allowed to do?* |
//!
//! The orchestration that ties them together lives in [`executor`]. A caller of
//! `execute` never names the sandbox or the materializer; the only knob that reaches
//! them is the action's `execution_mode` field — data on the action, not an API.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! Local execution only ([`LocalExecutor`]); `Executor` is a trait so a future
//! `RemoteExecutor` slots in without changing callers (§7.1). Linux `sealed` mode
//! uses `bubblewrap` for strict filesystem visibility and default network denial.
//! macOS `sealed` mode uses `sandbox-exec` for a Seatbelt filesystem/network
//! policy, but strict Linux-style namespace hermeticity still requires running on
//! Linux.
//! The precise sealed-mode contract lives in `docs/sandbox-contract.md`.
